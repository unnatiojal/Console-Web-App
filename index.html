         Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging,
         task running, and version control. It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick 
         code-build-debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to fuller featured IDEs, such as Visual Studio IDE.

         A console is the combination of a monitor and keyboard. It is a rudimentary interface in which the monitor 
         provides the output and the keyboard is used for input. To open the console screen, you can right-click on
         the web page and click Inspect Element or Inspect, and the developed window will appear. On top of the
         window, you can see a tab named console. Click on that.
